1. Strategize Your Rolls

Don’t just roll dice for the sake of rolling—plan your moves. Focus on landing on spaces that give you the best rewards, such as property acquisitions or special event spaces. Building properties and upgrading them will yield higher rent, giving you more in-game currency to work with.

2. Use Dice Rolls During Special Events

Timing your dice rolls during in-game events can pay off big. During events, certain spaces may offer double rewards, extra bonuses, or exclusive items. Prioritize using your free dice rolls when you know an event is active.

3. Save Dice Rolls for Multiplayer Matches

Monopoly GO! lets you compete against other players in multiplayer modes. Having a healthy stock of dice rolls in these matches increases your chances of dominating the board and winning bigger rewards. It’s always a good idea to save some rolls for when you need them most.

4. Keep an Eye on Time-Limited Offers

Throughout the year, Monopoly GO! will run special time-limited offers where you can purchase additional dice rolls or receive bonus rolls as part of a bundle. While you’re waiting for your free rolls to regenerate, these offers can be a good way to stock up on dice.

Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on Your Free Dice Rolls!
